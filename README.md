## Background
Exposure to negative economic shocks during ‘the first 1000 days’ from conception to the second birthday may adversely impact child growth and development. Between 2015 and 2020, India experienced a currency demonetization event followed by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which exposure to these two shocks predicts growth faltering among children under 5 years.    
## Methods
Using serial cross-sectional data from the Indian National Family Health Surveys (n = 237,088), we studied the association of 18 potential periods of exposure in the first 1000 days to demonetization and COVID-19 lockdowns in 14 states with stunting (HAZ < -2SD), underweight (WAZ < -2SD) and wasting (WHZ < -2SD). We used survey-weighted Poisson regressions with robust standard errors after adjusting for child, maternal and household covariates, as well as fixed effects for survey round, district and month of measurement.     
## Results
The prevalence of stunting (2015-16: 39.7%, 2019-20: 35.6%, 2020-21: 34.3%), underweight (2015-16: 36.4%, 2019-20: 27.3%, 2020-21: 28.4%), and wasting (2015-16: 20.8%, 2019-20: 17.3%, 2020-21: 16.4%) decreased over time. Prevalence was higher in rural compared to urban areas. After adjusting for covariates, exposure to demonetization at 13 to 24 months was associated with higher prevalence of wasting [prevalence ratio (PR): 1.21, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.43] in urban areas. In rural areas, exposure to lockdown during gestation was associated with higher prevalence of stunting (1.12, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.23) and underweight (1.19, 95%CI: 1.07, 1.34), but not wasting (0.95, 95%CI: 0.87, 1.04); no association was observed in urban areas.   
## Conclusions
Exposure to economic shocks in India during the first 1000 days was associated with an overall higher prevalence of undernutrition, with differential associations by age at exposure, and type of shock. Our study calls for prioritizing service delivery in the first 1000 days to ensure gains in reducing undernutrition are not reversed.
