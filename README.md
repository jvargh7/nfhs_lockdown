## Background: 
Restrictions on mobility to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in food insecurity, with potential implications for child undernutrition. The purpose of this study is to estimate the extent to which restricted mobility was associated with anthropometric changes among children under 5 years in India.   
## Methods: 
Using data on 14 states from the Indian National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21, n = 106,600), we studied the association of restricted mobility between 25 March and 24 September 2020 with height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ) and weight-for-height (WHZ) z-scores. Levels of mobility, relative to the pre-pandemic period, were derived from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Composite Mobility indicator . Cumulative restricted mobility in eight age intervals (Gestation, 0 to 6, 7 to 12, 13 to 18, 19 to 24, 25 to 36, 37 to 48 and 49 to 60 months) were calculated. We used survey-weighted linear regressions and fixed effects meta-analysis separately for rural and urban areas, adjusting for child, household, district- and state-level covariates, and corrected confidence intervals for multiple comparisons.
## Findings: 
Restricted mobility was associated with lower HAZ and WAZ among children under 36 months in rural areas. Restricted mobility during gestation or at age (in months) 0 to 6, 7 to 12 and 13 to 18 were associated with -0.17 [-0.35, 0.01], -0.19 [-0.39, 0.01], -0.31 [-0.49, -0.13], and -0.19 [95%CI: -0.34, -0.03] lower HAZ per 10,000 cumulative restriction points, equivalent to a 50% reduction in mobility for a six-month period. Restricted mobility was not associated with WHZ in rural areas nor with HAZ, WAZ or WHZ in urban areas.   
## Interpretation: 
Restricted mobility resulting from efforts to minimize community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with growth faltering among rural children under 36 months.
